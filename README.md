My Programming Adventure.
Hello fellow programmers. I am a greenhorn.
I am still learning Python and then learn R.
My plan is to become a Microbiologist as well
as a Data Scientist that can manipulate large datasets
and present research data in an informative way.
You are welcome to look around at my GitHub repo.
